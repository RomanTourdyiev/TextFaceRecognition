# TextFaceRecognition
Machine Learning Text and Face recognition example

User points his camera at one of the pre-defined words like "justice", "genius", "hero". 
App recognizes this text (hand written or typed) and turns on selfie camera to overlay mask on user's face.
Which mask to use - key word dictates. "Justice" = "Batman", "Hero" = "Spiderman", "Genius" = "Ironman"
